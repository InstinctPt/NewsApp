# NewsApp
This was a small little project done by me do understand better how the IOS ecosystem works, to learn how to program with swift and also get used to the Xcode IDE. 

The objective of this programme is to know what are the top-headlines, the sports news and the economic news of the world. In order to do this project i used:

  -> API to get the latest news - https://newsapi.org
    ->Get json file from API and use in array
  
  -> ListView with Custom Cells 
  
  -> Tab Bar and Navigation Bar
  
  -> WebKit
